# FitFriends: Submitted to the Scout Healthcare Track for HackNC 2020

FitFriends is an app designed to help motivate groups of friends to work out and stay healthy while keeping safe through social distancing. 
Users can join rooms with friends and decide on a shared goal --- maybe to run a combined 50 miles or spend a combined total of 10 hours walking. 
As users record their workouts, they move around the screen towards the finish line. Users can also check on their individual and group progress through a leaderboard, which displays each person's statistics and how much they've contributed to the group goal.
